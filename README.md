# nose-calculations
This repository is about a numerical calculation code package to study thermodynamic properties in various animal noses. 

## Getting started
#### The easiest and simplest way to install all codes for modelling an animal nose by 'nose-calculations'
#### 

  1. git clone https://github.com/hyejeonc/nose-calculations.git
  2. Open 'Nose_t.m' file in Matlab.
  3. Depending on the 
  4. Depending on the parameters you want to use, open 'Parameters.m' and change it. 


#### Nose_t.m
## A main file for running a simulation. 


#### Parameters.m
## To change 'default' physical and thermodynamic parameters, you should change it, i.e., heat capacity of mucus lining.
